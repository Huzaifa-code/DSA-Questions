To Compile your C++ code use:-

g++ file_name.cpp -o executable_file_name

         (i) -o option is used to show error in the code 
        (ii) if there is no error in the code_file, then it will generate an executable file.

    Now execute the generated executable file:

    ./executable_file_name
